# Planning - Future Development

## Purpose
This section contains forward-looking planning documents including roadmaps, planned features, and future directions for RetroCase.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning and roadmap documentation
- **Stability:** Dynamic (changes frequently)
- **Abstraction:** Strategic and conceptual
- **Confidence:** Evolving (plans change)

## Planning Documents

### [`module-roadmap.md`](module-roadmap.md)
**Planned Modules and Priorities**

The development roadmap for new modules and features.

**Contains:**
- Prioritized list of planned modules
- Implementation timeline estimates (phases, not dates)
- Dependencies between planned modules
- Research needed for future modules

### [`preset-catalog.md`](preset-catalog.md)
**Planned Preset Designs**

Catalog of pre-configured complete designs to be added to `presets/`.

**Contains:**
- Preset design specifications
- Target hardware for each preset
- Design parameters and variations
- Priority and status

### [`hardware-targets.md`](hardware-targets.md)
**Hardware Compatibility Targets**

Target hardware platforms and mounting specifications.

**Contains:**
- Raspberry Pi models and dimensions
- ESP32 variants
- Arduino boards
- Audio amplifier modules
- Display panel sizes

## Planning Principles

### Plans Are Living Documents
Plans evolve as we learn. Don't treat them as immutable specifications.

### Prioritization Over Scheduling
We prioritize what to build, but don't estimate dates. Focus on "what" and "why," not "when."

### Research Flags
Some planned items are marked "Research Needed" - these require investigation before implementation.

## Navigation Patterns

### For Understanding Priorities
Start with [`module-roadmap.md`](module-roadmap.md) to see what's planned and why.

### For Design Ideas
Browse [`preset-catalog.md`](preset-catalog.md) for inspiration and target use cases.

### For Hardware Integration
Check [`hardware-targets.md`](hardware-targets.md) for supported platforms.

## Relationship to Other Sections

**Decisions →** Planning: Past decisions guide future plans
**Planning →** Domains: Plans become domain knowledge as implemented
**Foundation →** Planning: Core vision drives what we plan

## Navigation

**Up:** [`../discovery.md`](../discovery.md) - Main context network navigation

**Related Sections:**
- [`../decisions/`](../decisions/index.md) - Past decisions that inform plans
- [`../domains/`](../domains/index.md) - Current domain implementation
- [`../foundation/project-definition.md`](../foundation/project-definition.md) - Vision that guides planning

## Updating Planning Documents

Planning documents should be updated:
- When new ideas emerge
- After completing planned items
- When priorities shift
- When research reveals new information

See [`../meta/maintenance.md`](../meta/maintenance.md) for update procedures.
