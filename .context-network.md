# RetroCase Context Network

## Location
The context network for this project is located at: `context-network/`

Start here: [`context-network/discovery.md`](context-network/discovery.md)

## Purpose
This context network contains all planning documents, architectural decisions, design documentation, and team coordination information for the RetroCase parametric OpenSCAD library.

## What Belongs in the Context Network

**Context Network (Team Memory):**
- Architecture diagrams and decisions
- Implementation plans and strategies
- System design documentation
- Research findings and explorations
- Development workflows and processes
- Bug investigations and solutions
- Design discussions and rationale
- Discovery records and location indexes

**Project Files (Build Artifacts):**
- OpenSCAD source code (`.scad` files)
- Configuration files
- Build and render scripts
- Examples and presets
- Public-facing documentation (README)
- Test outputs and renders

## Usage Guidelines

- **ALL planning documents, architecture diagrams, and design discussions** MUST be stored within the context network
- **Do NOT** place planning or architecture documents in the project root
- **ALWAYS consult** the context network before implementing new features
- **UPDATE** the context network as you work - don't wait until task completion
- **RECORD** your understanding in the context network, not just in conversation
